### Brief Description of Project
* "The Global Institution" is a tuition-based educational institution that serves students in grades 6 through 12. As a result of the institution's decision to conduct online classes for the benefit of students and owing to the increasing expansion of students, online classes will be offered. Students can pay for lessons via online means, attend classes, and participate in exams, among other things. They can use the given credentials to access the online application at any time and from any location. Test results can be viewed on the exam portal by students. The main benefit is that the management operations are automated, allowing them to keep student and teacher information in the cloud.
